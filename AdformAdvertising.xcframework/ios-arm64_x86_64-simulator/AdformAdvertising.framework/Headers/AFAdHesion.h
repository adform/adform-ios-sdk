 The AFAdHesion class provides a view container that displays sticky inline advertisements.
 
 You can use this class to place ad banners at the top or bottom of the screen.
 They are automatically positioned to be fully visible to the user
 and won't be obscured by navigation or tool bars (in case of extended view controller layout).

 Do not try to replace this gesture recognizer by overriding the property.
 If you tie this gesture recognizer to one of your own, 
 make sure both recognize their gestures simultaneously to ensure that each has a chance to handle the event.
