 If this method is not implemented the AFAdInterstitial will not close when close arrea or button is clicked.
 
 In this method you should implement any animations used when closing the ad.
 When the animations are finished you must call the completionHandler and pass a bool value
 indicating if everything went ok, and ad has been closed. It is very important to call this block
 to allow the ad view to update its internal state correctly.
