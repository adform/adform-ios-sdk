### New Features

* WKWebView support. We have changed SDK to use WKWebView to render HTML banners. WKWebView is used by default on iOS 8+ and UIWebView is used on older iOS versions.

# 2.7.2

### New Features

### Migration from older versions

The new SDK version uses different method for setting key values to a banner. 
Therefore, if you were setting key values to banners using older sdk you need to update it.
You can use two methods to do it:
 1. Create an NSArray with AFKeyValue objects and set it to the banner.
 2. Use "AFKeyValuesFromNSDictionary()" function to convert a NSDictionary with key values that you used to set to the banner, to NSArray with AFKeyValue objects and set it to the banner.
 
You can find an example [here](https://github.com/adform/adform-ios-sdk/wiki/Adding-key-value-pairs).
